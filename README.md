# Personal Website

> 🌓 This site features both **professional** and **personal** views, use the toggle in the corner to switch modes.

## 🧭 What is this?

This is my website to share who I am, what I do, and what I enjoy.
Whether you're here to explore my **professional work** or get a glimpse of my **personal side**, you can switch between both with ease.

## 🛠️ Why the Dual Modes?

I believe that personality and professionalism aren't mutually exclusive.
This site is designed to reflect both my engineering projects and technical experience to hobbies, thoughts, and creative explorations.

Thanks for visiting — feel free to explore! 🌐
